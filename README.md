# Fraud-detection
The goal of this project would be to detect fraudulent transactions by analyzing the graph structure of the transaction network. Each transaction could be represented as a node in the graph, with edges connecting nodes that represent transactions between the same accounts.

To accomplish this, you could use a pretrained graph neural network model such as the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) or Graph Attention Network (GAT) model. These models are capable of analyzing the graph structure and learning features of nodes and edges, which can be used for various tasks such as node classification and link prediction.

You could use these pretrained models to perform various fraud detection tasks, such as detecting anomalous transactions and identifying fraudulent networks of accounts. For example, you could use the GCN model to learn the patterns of legitimate transactions, and then identify anomalous transactions that deviate significantly from these patterns. You could also use the GAT model to identify clusters of accounts that are connected in a suspicious way, which could indicate a fraudulent network.

Once you have developed the model and integrated it into the company's fraud detection pipeline, it could be used to automatically detect fraudulent transactions, potentially saving the company millions of dollars in losses. Additionally, it could help improve the company's reputation by demonstrating their commitment to preventing fraud and protecting their customers' assets.
